![TLauncher versionSelection.jpg](D:\minecraft\SKLauncher\Noobtifine%20development\Installer\Working%20directory\help%20assets\TLauncher%20versionSelection.jpg)

**IMPORTANT: TLauncher is known to modify their version releases for shady reasons [(more about it here)](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/d7060ec908f335408140325ee30884d20736b9216985321f7886d49bcbc48e75?environmentId=120), therefore its highly recommended to use original versions**

Fortunately Noobtifine bundles its own Quilt loader version from [original source](https://quiltmc.org/en/)

Noobtifine bundled Quilt loader has these characteristics:

**1.** quilt-loader

**2.** Quilt loader version

**3.** Minecraft version

# Installation Complete!

- TLauncher will now run with Noobtifine

# Tip:

- **Anti Aliasing (TAA)** can be enabled by using shaders accessible from: **Video settings > shaders > AntiAliasing shaders**

  - **Alternatively** you can make the game render in higher resolutions to eliminate jaggedness altogether, rather than just in motion like the shader implementation. **To do this: Mods > ResolutionControl+ > click the logo**<img src="file:///D:/minecraft/SKLauncher/Noobtifine%20development/Installer/Working%20directory/help%20assets/resolutioncontrol.jpg" title="" alt="resolutioncontrol.jpg" width="585">

- **Leaves may look bad,** you can make it better by changing **Cull Leaves Depth** (video settings > performance)
  
  | Cull Leaves Depth = 4                                                                                                                                                        | Cull Leaves Depth = 1                                                                                                                                                        |

  ***Increasing Cull Leaves Depth reduces FPS mainly in dense forests**

- As long as there's enough RAM, you can increase the game render distance to whatever you want with ***minimal fps impact*** if you set  `singleplayer server view distance` (in Mods > Bobby > click the logo ) to your usual render distance
